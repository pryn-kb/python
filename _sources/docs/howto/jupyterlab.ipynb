    "### Step 1: Open JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Terminal**:\n",
    "   - **Open Terminal**:\n",
    "     - You can find Terminal by using Spotlight Search (press `Cmd + Space` and type \"Terminal\") or by navigating to `Applications` > `Utilities` > `Terminal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Navigate to Your Project Directory** (Optional):\n",
    "     - If you want to start JupyterLab in a specific directory, use the `cd` command to navigate there. For example:\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       cd path/to/your/project\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - If you're unsure of the path, you can drag the folder directly into the Terminal window, and it will automatically input the correct path.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Finder** (Alternative Method):\n",
    "   - **Open the Desired Folder in Finder**:\n",
    "     - Navigate to the folder where you want to start JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Open Terminal from Finder**:\n",
    "     - Right-click on the folder while holding the `Control` key (or use a two-finger tap on a trackpad) and select **\"New Terminal at Folder\"**.\n",
    "     - If you don’t see this option, you might need to enable the \"New Terminal at Folder\" service. To do this:\n",
    "       - Go to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard` > `Shortcuts` > `Services`.\n",
    "       - Check the box next to \"New Terminal at Folder\" under the \"Files and Folders\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Start JupyterLab**:\n",
    "   - In Terminal, type the following command and press `Enter`:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     jupyter lab\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - JupyterLab will open in your default web browser. If it doesn’t, copy the URL provided in the Terminal and paste it into your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Navigate the File/Directory System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Browser**:\n",
    "   - On the left sidebar of JupyterLab, you’ll see the **File Browser**. This shows the directory contents of the folder where JupyterLab was started.\n",
    "   - You can open folders by clicking on them. Files (e.g., notebooks, Python scripts) can be opened by clicking on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create New Files and Folders**:\n",
    "   - To create a new file or folder, right-click anywhere in the File Browser and select **New Folder** or **New File**. You can also click the `+` icon at the top of the File Browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Upload Files**:\n",
    "   - You can drag and drop files from your Finder directly into the File Browser in JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Navigate Between Folders**:\n",
    "   - Use the arrows next to folders to expand and collapse them.\n",
    "   - You can also use the breadcrumbs at the top of the File Browser to navigate back to parent directories.\n"

    "   - **Open Command Prompt from File Explorer**:\n",
    "     - Right-click on the folder while holding the `Shift` key and select **\"Open command window here\"** or **\"Open PowerShell window here\"**. This depends on your Windows version.\n",
    "     - On newer versions of Windows 10 and 11, this option might be replaced with **\"Open in Terminal\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Start JupyterLab**:\n",
