    "By using external libraries, you can save time, avoid mistakes, and focus on the problem you actually want to solve.\\\n",

    "\n",
    "However, Python really shines because of its external libraries. A library is a collection of code that someone else has written, which you can use to make your own work easier.\\\n",

    "### Installing libraries\n",
    "When you install Python, it comes with Core Python - the built-in parts of the language. To do more advanced things, you often need to install external libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries can be installed from the [**Python Package Index (PyPI)**](https://pypi.org) using `pip`, Python’s package installer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This command installs the `requests` library using pip:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not installed `requests` before, this will download and install the latest version of the library along with its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` commands are most often run through a shell such as the Terminal on macOS or the Command Prompt on Windows.  \n",
    "However, you can also run shell commands directly from Jupyter notebooks by adding an exclamation mark `!` in front of the command:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "! pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to make sure you have the newest version of a library. You can do this by adding the `--upgrade` flag:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "pip install --upgrade requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding `--upgrade` not only installs the library if it is not already installed but also updates it to the latest version if you already have it.  \n",
    "This is useful for making sure you have the newest features and bug fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, in Jupyter notebooks you can run this with:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "! pip install --upgrade requests\n",

    "### Importing libraries\n",
    "Installing or upgrading makes a library available on your computer. To actually use it in your code, you need to import it. Importing happens *inside your Python program*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to install a library once before you can use it - and you may occasionally upgrade it to get the latest version.\\\n",

    "### Using aliases\n",
    "Sometimes libraries have long names, and programmers like to shorten them when importing. This is called using an **alias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `pandas` library is almost always imported like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells Python: “Import the library called `pandas`, but in my code I will refer to it as `pd`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 2, 3]})\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other standard conventions include:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These conventions save typing, and because so many people use them, they make your code easier to read and share."

    "## Who makes libraries, and are they safe?\n",
    "Libraries are written by individuals, research groups, companies, and communities of developers. Some of the most widely used libraries - such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` - are maintained by large teams and used by millions of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, libraries that are widely used and actively maintained are considered safe. However, because libraries are just code that someone else has written, it is possible for poorly maintained or unknown libraries to contain errors or even malicious code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for safety:**\n",
    "- Prefer well-known libraries with good documentation\n",
    "- Look at how often the library is updated\n",
    "- When in doubt, ask or research before installing an unfamiliar library"
