    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The line `user_guess = int(input(...))` can raise an exception if the user types something that is not a number.\n",
    "- By placing this line inside a `try/except` block, we can catch the error and respond gracefully.\n",
    "- The `except Exception as e` block prints a helpful message and the program continues without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the game only accepts valid integers, but still lets the user try again if they make a mistake.\n",
