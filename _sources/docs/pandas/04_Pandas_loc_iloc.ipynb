    "# What are `loc` and `iloc`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`loc` and `iloc` in pandas are technically properties that return a specialized indexer object. These indexer objects allow for label-based (`loc`) and integer-based (`iloc`) indexing. Although they behave similarly to methods in that you use them to perform actions (i.e., selecting or slicing data), they are properties because they return an indexing object rather than directly executing a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access `loc` or `iloc` on a DataFrame, what you're getting is not a simple value but an object that has its own methods and behaviors, specifically designed to handle indexing operations. This design allows for the concise and powerful data selection syntax that pandas is known for."

    "## When to use `loc` or `iloc`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positional Selection**: When the selection is purely positional (selecting the first five rows, or columns 2 to 4), `iloc` is the most straightforward tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inclusive Slicing:** `loc` allows for inclusive label-based slicing, simplifying the specification of row and column ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Label-based Complex Indexing**: For complex indexing scenarios where you need to select rows and columns based on their labels, `loc` is indispensable. It allows for intuitive and concise syntax that boolean masks cannot provide alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency and Readability**: In cases where using a boolean mask leads to verbose or inefficient code, `loc` or `iloc` might offer a more elegant and performant solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while boolean masks are powerful for filtering rows based on conditions, `loc` and `iloc` are essential for a wide range of other data selection tasks, particularly those involving specific column selection, positional indexing, and complex indexing scenarios that go beyond what boolean masks can achieve on their own."
