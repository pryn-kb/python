# Welcome to KUB Datalab's Python course

The  material you have in front of you is connected to the Datalab at University of Copenhagen. We currently offer a two-part introduction to python for absolute beginners as well as an introduction to the library Pandas. 

You can find and sign up for our courses [here](https://kubkalender.kb.dk/calendar/datalab?t=d&q=python&cid=6416&cal=6416&inc=0). Before you attend the beginners class please make sure to visit the "how to install and run python" page so we can get the most out of our time together. 

The materials you find in this Jupyter book are intended to help students learn how to code in python. All pages can be downloaded as a jupyter notebook as well as a pdf. That means that you can work with most of the code locally on your computer.
