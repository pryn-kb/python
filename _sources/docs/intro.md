# Welcome to KUB Datalab's Python course

The  material you have in front of you is connected to KUB Datalab at Copenhagen University Library. We currently offer a two-part introduction to Python for absolute beginners as well as an introduction to the library Pandas. 

You can find and sign up for our courses [here](https://kubkalender.kb.dk/calendar/datalab). Before you attend the beginners' class, please make sure to visit the How to... "Install & run Python" page so we can get the most out of our time together. 

The materials you find in this Jupyter Book are intended to help students learn how to code in Python. All pages can be downloaded as a Jupyter Notebook as well as pdf. That means that you can work with most of the code locally on your computer.
