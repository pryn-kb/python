    "The  material you have in front of you was developed in conjunction with the Python course offerings offered by [KUB Datalab](https://kub.kb.dk/datalab) at [Copenhagen University Library](https://kub.ku.dk/english/). We currently offer a two-part introduction to Python for absolute beginners as well as an introduction to the library Pandas. We recommend you review these materials to get the code “in your fingers” after the course. All of the pages can be [downloaded as Jupyter notebooks as well as PDF](howto/interact). That means that you can work with the code locally on your computer. \n",

    "You can find and sign up for our courses [here](https://kubkalender.kb.dk/calendar/datalab). Before you attend the beginners' class, please make sure to visit [Install & Run Python](howto/setup) so we can get the most out of our time together."

    "Learning how to code requires in many ways a shift in perspective.  Namely from the perspective of human, semantic meaning to that of computer logic and language.  An interesting way of trying to wrap your mind around it is reading up on how a computer reasons out an algorithm, and its metaphorical corollary of how ants determine the most efficient method to get to a food source. You can read more about that on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms).\n",
